# CS-433 - Road Segmentation
Project in CS-433 - Machine Learning, EPFL (Fall 2018).

Group: Maiken Berthelsen, Ida Sandsbraaten and Sigrid Wanvik Haugen.




### Running instructions:
- Packages that need to be installed are:
	- pip install ......
	- The Python version used is 3.6.5.
	- Keras version is 2.1.6-tf.

- Download the .zip-file containing the data set from https://www.crowdai.org/challenges/epfl-ml-road-segmentation/dataset_files. Make sure that the folder 'data' containing these files are in the same folder as the src folder.

- The code can be run by calling "python run.py" from your terminal. Make sure that you are in the src folder when running. This will load the best model and produce the submission file based on the implemented model and weights.

- The running is finished when "Finished" is printed to the terminal.

- The submission csv file can be found in the same folder with the name "results.csv".

- If you want to train the model, instead of loading the already trained one, change ____ .




### Code architecture:
This code contains the following files:
* run.py 

	The whole code can be executed by running run.py.

* helpers.py

	Contains the given functions for loading csv, predicting labels and create a csv submission.

* implementations.py
